### Reflecting on the year 

I think overall it was a great school year for me. If all grades stay mostly the same, I will have gotten the grades I wanted in all of my courses. I know I missed a few assignments for this course and I know I could have done better, but I am still satisfied knowing I learned a lot. The two IT courses I took this semester were the first online courses I have ever done. It was tough to transition and hard to keep up, but it did allow for more flexibility in my schedule. It was nice to only have one class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. It was a late class too, so I could sleep in. I feel that it helped with my performance in other classes as well, since I was able to keep a good sleep schedule going. Although I donâ€™t have any online courses scheduled for next semester, I think that this experience helped me realize that it is always a good option to take a class online if I need to.
