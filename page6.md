### Plan for the future 

Even though I am going back to business, I would love to keep learning code on Codecademy at my own pace. Technology is the future, and that means coding is going to be pretty useful to learn. I had a great time going through the introductory courses of JavaScript on Codecademy. It was really easy to learn and since you can do it at your own pace, you can take as much time as you want with it. I am not sure whether I might try to get some sort of minor or anything in something related to coding, but I think that even as a hobby it can be cool. Coding is like a ton of other languages to learn. I think that thereâ€™s so much to know about coding and I would love to learn more and more about it throughout my life.

Anyway, since I still need another image to meet the requirement and finals are coming up, what better way to top this project off than a nice relatable meme from _The Office_?
