### My favorite parts of the course

Overall, I enjoyed this course. It was nice to learn about all the variety of things we covered. Some of my favorite assignments were

* The Simple Computer Simulation (see below)
* The Python Turtle Graphic
* Using [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) to learn about JavaScript

The Simple Computer Simulation was a cool assignment because of how different it was. I never thought I would be following directions and shading inside the boxes of a worksheet in college, especially in this day and age when _everything_ is digital! This assignment also made the complexity of how a computer runs seem simple! I was surprised by this assignment, it was definitely one of my favorites!
