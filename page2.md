### What I learned 

This course helped me learn several of the basics of Information Technology. I learned about coding in a plain text editor, coding in Python, and then coding with JavaScript. But we also learned a lot of useful information, such as the digital technology unit and what we read about in the intellectual property module. Before taking any IT course, I used to think that it was a very simple job. I always thought it was basically just sitting in an office of any school, office building, or basically anywhere with computers, and waiting for people to come to you with a problem. I didnâ€™t know that there was much of a coding aspect to it. This course helped me realize that.
