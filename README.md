IT 1000 Final Project

## Intro to Information Technology
 
### Why I took this course 

At the end of last school year, I visited with my advisor and decided I wanted to switch out of being a business major. I wanted to explore something that had more to do with computers since business was just not doing it for me. I decided to explore Information Technology, since I had heard of it through a few friends. I visited with an engineering advisor and she helped get me enrolled in this class and another IT course.
