### What I learned 

This course helped me learn several of the basics of Information Technology. I learned about coding in a plain text editor, coding in Python, and then coding with JavaScript. But we also learned a lot of useful information, such as the digital technology unit and what we read about in the intellectual property module. Before taking any IT course, I used to think that it was a very simple job. I always thought it was basically just sitting in an office of any school, office building, or basically anywhere with computers, and waiting for people to come to you with a problem. I didnâ€™t know that there was much of a coding aspect to it. This course helped me realize that.

I also feel like I came a long way from the beginning of the semester. I remember the aboutMe assignment and how simple it was. Now, while I am doing this final project, even though it is a different coding language, I feel like I have learned so much about coding.

    print("My name is Carlos Nevarez.")
    print("I am currently a sophomore at Mizzou.")
    print("This is my first year as an Information Technology major, I switched from the business track.")
    print("I am also enrolled in IT 1040, so I have worked with Python before this challenge.")

I remember this being what I coded for the aboutMe challenge. Back then it did seem a bit challenging, but now I feel like I could do that so easily.
